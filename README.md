## 🌟 Overview

NanoQuant is a cutting-edge model compression framework that enables efficient deployment of large language models (LLMs) and other deep learning models. It provides state-of-the-art compression techniques to reduce model size and inference time while maintaining model accuracy.

### 🔥 Key Features

- **Advanced Quantization**: 4-bit and 8-bit quantization with minimal accuracy loss
- **Pruning**: Structured and unstructured pruning for model size reduction
- **Knowledge Distillation**: Transfer knowledge from larger models to smaller ones
- **Hardware-Aware Optimization**: Optimized for various hardware backends
- **Multi-Model Support**: Works with popular model architectures (Transformers, CNNs, etc.)
- **Easy Integration**: Simple API for model compression and deployment

## 📦 Repositories

This is the main repository that coordinates between our public and private components:

- **Public Repository**: [nanoquant-public](https://github.com/swayam8624/nanoquant-public) - Contains open-source components and examples

## 🛠️ Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/swayam8624/Nanoquant.git
cd Nanoquant

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 🚀 Quick Start

```python
from nanoquant import NanoQuant

# Load your model
model = YourModel()

# Initialize NanoQuant
nq = NanoQuant(model)

# Apply compression
compressed_model = nq.compress(
    method='int8',
    calibration_data=calibration_loader,
    optimize_for='cpu'  # or 'cuda', 'tensorrt', etc.
)

# Save compressed model
nq.save_compressed_model('compressed_model.nq')
```

## 📊 Performance

| Model | Original Size | Compressed Size | Compression Ratio | Accuracy Drop |
|-------|--------------|-----------------|-------------------|---------------|
| BERT-base | 440MB | 110MB | 4x | <1% |
| GPT-2 | 1.5GB | 380MB | 4x | 0.8% |
| ResNet-50 | 98MB | 25MB | 4x | 0.5% |
